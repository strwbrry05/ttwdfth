# ttwdfth (tiktok went down for twelve hours)
[2025] A web focused page (HTML/CSS/JS) dedicated to archiving the creator's favorite tiktoks in leiu of the first massive tiktok shutdown of 2025. Each category contains its own set of videos along with functional controls for moving between and pausing said videos. Page is, additionally, responsive, with a completely different look depending on if the user is on a mobile device or a larger screen.

## About the Project
Created slightly after properly learning about web design principles, this page contains sleek and aesthetically pleasing colors, formatting, and fonts. In addition, I had just finished a course on Javascript fundamentals and couldnt wait to put them to use. What better way to do that than to create your own project and have fun with it. The tiktok shut down, like many other individuals my age, brought upon fear and panic. I would no longer be able to see the videos that had brightened my day or made me laugh on various occasions. In response, I created this website as more of a challenge to myself than anything, to see what exactly I had learned up to this point and what my current limits were. To this day, I think fondly of this page and everything I was able to accomplish with it.
