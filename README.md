# ttwdfth (tiktok went down for twelve hours)
[2025] A web focused page (HTML/CSS/JS) dedicated to archiving the creator's favorite tiktoks in leiu of the first massive tiktok shutdown of 2025. Each category contains its own set of videos along with functional controls for moving between and pausing said videos. Page is, additionally, responsive, with a completely different look depending on if the user is on a mobile device or a larger screen.

## About the Project
Created slightly after properly learning about web design principles, this page contains sleek and aesthetically pleasing colors, formatting, and fonts. In addition, I had just finished a course on Javascript fundamentals and couldnt wait to put them to use. What better way to do that than to create your own project and have fun with it. The tiktok shut down, like many other individuals my age, brought upon fear and panic. I would no longer be able to see the videos that had brightened my day or made me laugh on various occasions. In response, I created this website as more of a challenge to myself than anything, to see what exactly I had learned up to this point and what my current limits were. To this day, I think fondly of this page and everything I was able to accomplish with it.

### Home
Horizontal scroll layout; with catgegories glowing and enlarging when hovered over. Contains the ability to drag to scroll or just use the scroll bar provided.

### Video View
After selecting a catgory, videos will automatically begin to play. Provided are two arrows to move back and forth between videos. If the user wishes to pause a video, all they simply need to do is click on the video and a pause symbol will appear. To return to the home page, a user can either press the home button or select the title, both of which will return the user.

## Responsive View
When page is viewed through a mobile screen, the controls for viewing videos are slightly different. The home screen largely remains the same. After selecting a category of video, user instructions/directions will present themselves. In order to move between videos, the user needs to click on either the left side of the screen or the right side of the screen. There are also three addional controls at the bottom of the page. The first is to play/pause the video. The second is to return home (a user may also select the title to return home). The third is to mute the current video.

## Potential Improvements
- MOBILE_VIDEO: If possible, I'd like for the bottom menu to have stuck to the bottom of the user's screen like an actual menu/nav bar. For that to happen, each video would have to be resized, OR the bottom menu would have to have used a sticky display.
- MOBILE_VIDEO: Ideally, the instructions menu wouldnt appear each time a user selects a new catgory, but for mobile development, videos don't automatically play. Perhaps, I could find a way around that.

- DESKTOP_VIDEO: Only issue I see with the desktop videos are the video sizes, they could potentially be larger in order to have better optics for the user.
- DESKTOP_VIDEO: Additionally, it would have been nice to provide a mute button for desktop videos as well as a download button for users who wish to save that specific video themselves.
